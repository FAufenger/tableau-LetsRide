![Start page of story (age)](./Images/agePage.png)

This page investigates the age of riders

  * Here we find that the max age for most months is well over 100 years old! 
  * The age range from 20-60 use the most unique bicycles with a peak at 30 years of age.
  * We also see two groups 30 and 50 year old who rent the most bikes. Strangely though we have a spike at 80 for the longest average duration.
